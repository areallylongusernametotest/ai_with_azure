## What is Machine Learning

> Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, behaviours and trends.

## Applications of Machine Learning

The applications of machine learning are extremely broad! And the opportunities cut across industry verticals. Whether the industry is healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, government or education.
A few examples include:-

- Automate the recognition of disease
- Recommend next best actions for individual care plans
- Enable personalized, real-time banking experience with chatbots
- Identify the next best action for the customer
- capture, prioritize, and route service requests to the correct employee and improve response times.

## The Data Science Process

Big data has become part of the lexicon of organizations worldwide, as more and more organizations look to leverage data to drive informed business decisions. With this evolution in business decision-making, the amount of raw data collected, along with the number and diversity of data sources is growing at an astounding rate. This data presents enormous potential.

Raw data, however is often noisy and unreliable and may contain missing values and outliers. Using such data for modelling can produce misleading results. For the data scientist, the ability to combine large, disparate data sets into a format more appropriate for analysis is an increasingly crucial skill.

The data science process typically starts with collecting and preparing the data before moving on to training, evaluating and deploying a model.

Collect Data -> Prepare Data -> Train Model -> Evaluate Model -> Deploy Model

## The Types of Data

- Numerical
- Time-Series
- Categorical
- Text
- Image

### Tabular Data

In machine learning, the most common type of data you'll encounter is tabular data - that is, data that is arranged in a data table.

It is important to know that in machine learning, we ultimately always work with numbers or specifically _vectors_.

> A vector is simply an array of numbers, such as `(1,2,3)` - or a nested array that contains other arrays of numbers such as `(1,2,(1,2,3))`

Vectors are used heavily in machine learning.
